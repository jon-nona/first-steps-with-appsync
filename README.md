## Setting Up The Project

### Deploying The Backend

You need to have set up the AWS CLI and have your account credentials set. You also need to have AWS CDK installed.
To deploy the backend:

- `cd cdk-chat`
- `cdk synth`
- `cdk deploy`

Answer yes to any of the questions that you are asked. Note that the user referenced by your credentials need to have the necessary permissions to create the resources.
